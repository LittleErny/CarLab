So, the bigger ``odometer_km`` is, the lower ``price_EUR`` is.\n* Additionally, the newer car is, the more it costs. Or, the bigger ``registration_year`` is, the bigger ``price_EUR`` is.\n* Also, the newer car is, the less километраж it has, which is pretty logical.\n* There is also a small correlation between ``power_bs`` and ``registration_year`` - new cars tend to be more powerful than older\n* And obviouthere is no correlation",

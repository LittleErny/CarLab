So, the bigger `odometer_km` is, the lower `price_EUR` is.  \n* Additionally, the newer the car is, the more it costs. Or, the bigger `registration_year` is, the bigger `price_EUR` is.  \n* Also, the newer the car is, the less mileage it has, which is pretty logical.  \n* There is also a small correlation between `power_bs` and `registration_year` - new cars tend to be more powerful than older ones.

This script uses Streamlit to visualize and analyze a cleaned dataset of car sales from eBay Germany.
Future improvements:
- Refactor the code for better readability and maintainability.
- Add markdown sections for better explanations and context.
- Enhance data visualizations and add more graphs.
- Optimize performance by using pre-downloaded data instead of downloading from Kaggle.
- Provide detailed explanations for numerical data correlations with categorical variables to improve readability.
